# mygit

I worked on a project at Intel where I was heavily involved with extending git. The product's purpose was primarily to improve the possibilities to aggregate git projects and use binary data, in a similar way to the Android team's repo tool, but in Java instead of in Python.

I wanted to
- extend my knowledge of git
- get some more practice with Modern C++
by writing a git client from first principles.
